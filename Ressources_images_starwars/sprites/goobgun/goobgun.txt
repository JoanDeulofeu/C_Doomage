The Background of the Mark IV Goobgun

The Mark IV Goobgun was originally created for the Empire by Moff Rebus. The Emperor
had decided to arm his troops at the Imperial garrison on Tatooine with a new crowd
control weapon designed to quell uprisings by an increasingly insurgent populace.
Rebus designed a weapon that could be used against multiple targets at once while at
the same time utilizing an inexpensive form of ammunition in the form of ultra-high
energy plasma.

After completing the construction of a Mark III prototype, Rebus was informed by the
Emperor's advisors that the project was to be terminated, owing to a reduction of 
funding to the Tatooine garrison. Bitter and with little resources remaining to 
continue working on his pet project, he turned to an old business partner with 
the Kell's Fang, an Outer Rim gang of smugglers and arms dealers. While headquartered
on Tatooine, Moff Rebus completed the final prototype of the Mark IV Goobgun, and
made plans to sell the weapon on the profitable black market.
