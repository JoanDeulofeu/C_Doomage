A custom-made component for add-on Dark Forces levels
by Lionel Fouillen (c) December 1996.

This package contains one FME file of an Air Vaporator,
as seen in various places on planet Tatooine in the
film Star Wars (A New Hope).

This FME file may be used in your own add-on levels
provided I'm given proper credit.
