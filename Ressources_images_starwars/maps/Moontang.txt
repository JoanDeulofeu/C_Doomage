Known Bugs              : None

May Not Run With...     : HRP - Vine textures don't match up, palettes aren't compatible and causes lag.

Important Notes         : Made for Polymer Eduke32. 

(Polymer is optional but looks great, Map weights in at a light 989 sectors so lag in minimal to non existent).
                          
                          Beware of the Gremlins.

                          Teddy Bear is holding an Atomic. Use Devastator or RPG (Pipe Bombs won't work.)

                          Vending Machines are your Friend. (gives up to 4 items or 3 & a slime to the face.)
