Description           :This is a fairly large single-play level. It's
                       setting is in an alien arctic base featuring 
                       several unique areas. Some of which are: an 
                       underwater power station, storage and carbon
                       freezing facility and a training area for alien
                       divers. The enemies are everywhere as Duke 
                       explores the base. Don't worry though, this
                       level is loaded with ammo & weapons. Oh ya, and
                       keep your eyes open for Bobafett's Slave 1 ship.
