Description           : The immediate successor to FOS Station. 
					  : Duke must explore an abandoned Russian space
					  : station, power on its reactor, and escape to Earth!

			
Dumb Notices		  : This map was DESIGNED in Classic and Polymost mode.
					  : This map WILL RUN with Polymer.
					  
					  : However, play Polymer at your own risk. To be
					  : specific, the catwalk room may cause your CPU to slag. :P
					  
					  : I have NO CLUE if it will run with the HRP, but
					  : feel free to try!
					  
					  : This map was NOT tested for compatibility with 
					  : people who are ambidextrous, people who stand on
					  : their heads, people who can't just play a map and enjoy it,
					  : people who think that 100% of furries are crazy (really, the figure
					  : is only like 99.2%, how dare you generalize like that!),
					  : people who like reading readme files (good on you, mate!),
					  : people who can count in binary, people who can't count in binary,
					  : or rubber duckies. The map is not known or is not not known to
					  : not be not compatible with rubber duckies. You've been warned. 
					  : DON'T USE THE RUBBER DUCKY! D:

Important Notes        : This map may be reproduced in its original format
			 (And by 'original format' I mean 'the unmodified
			 zipfile') in any media that now exists (the Internet, 
			 DVDs, carrier pidgeon, etched stone tablets) or will 
			 exist in the future (Infonet, IPv6 Internet, UberLazarDisk,
			 StarFleet Databanks) as long as all files are unmodified, 
			 credit is given to the original author (Supertanker), 
			 and there is no charge or fee beyond reasonable distribution
			 fees (The cost of a CD-R, bandwidth, packaging, or distribution media). 
			 Commercial use of this level (Say, in a total conversion that is 
			 'commercial' and costs well more than the cost of the distribution media)
			 is prohibited. After all, I put all the sweat into this level, not you,
			 and I am certainly not getting paid for it or for distributing it.

			 Although I'd prefer you didn't, you may use this level as a
			 base for a new level (As long as it is released under the same 
			 terms as dictated above), so long as credit is clearly given to 
			 the original author (Supertanker) for designing the base map.

			 Feel free to use the song (cherenkov.ogg) so long as you give me credit;
			 it's an original composition by me.
